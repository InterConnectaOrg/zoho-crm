## Requirements

* Get yourself a [Zoho CRM account](https://www.zoho.com/crm/).
* [Register your application](https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/php-sdk/clientapp.html)
* PHP >= 7.2
* Laravel >= 5.8

## Installation

Add Laravel-Mollie to your composer file via the `composer require` command:

```bash
$ composer require interconnecta/zoho-crm
```

Or add it to `composer.json` manually:

```json
"require": {
    "interconnecta/zoho-crm": "dev-develop"
}
```

Zoho CRM's service providers will be automatically registered using Laravel's auto-discovery feature.

## Configuration

The defaults configuration settings are set in `config/zohocrm.php`. Copy this file to your own config directory to modify the values. You can publish the config using this command:

```bash
$ php artisan zohocrm:install
```

You'll need to add the following variables to your .env file. Use the credentials previously obtained registering your application.

```php
ZOHOCRM_CLIENT_ID=
ZOHOCRM_CLIENT_SECRET=
ZOHOCRM_REDIRECT_URI=
ZOHOCRM_CURRENT_USER_EMAIL=
ZOHOCRM_SANDBOX=
```

Then, follow the next steps:
1. Go to [Zoho CRM Developer Console](https://accounts.zoho.com/developerconsole).
2. Under the Client previously registered, click the vertical three points then `Self Client`.
3. Enter `aaaserver.profile.READ,ZohoCRM.modules.ALL,ZohoCRM.settings.ALL`, then click `View Code`.
4. Copy the generated code.

Finally, run the following command:

```bash
$ php artisan zohocrm:setup
```

Enter the previously generated code.

**Zoho CRM is ready to use.**
